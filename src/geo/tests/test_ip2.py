"""Thread-safety tests for the IP2Location handle cache (issue #637).

FILE_IO mode reads through a single shared file cursor, so one instance shared
across gthread worker threads corrupts concurrent reads. ``get_ip2location`` must
hand each thread its own handle, while still hot-reloading when the ``.BIN`` is
replaced by the downloader.
